## Algorithms library

This repository contains implementation of various algorithms as well as some solutions to problems I implement on programming contests. 
Thus, it is in constant WIP status. Feel free to use whatever you find useful, although no bug-free guarantees provided. 
I thank the author for great book where I constantly find new ideas [Competitive's Programmer Handbook](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf)
