Run is guaranteed only in Linux-environment, other platforms are not considered. You need [gcc compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org/) and [address sanitizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AddressSanitizer).
When these two are at place, the following command:
```
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
``` 
will compile the code and execute binary. Then, in .cpp file there is an example of input you can use to test the program locally, or you can come up with your own. 
Alternatively, you can check that it passes all the tests in [cses system](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1193/) by submitting the .cpp source code.
