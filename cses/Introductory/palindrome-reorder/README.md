# Tests:
Check that it passes all the tests in [cses system](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1755/) by submitting the .rs source code.
Alternatively, in .rs file there is an example of input you can use to test the program locally, or you can come up with your own example out of curiousity and verify the correctness.
For this, you need to run the program on your machine.
# Run
Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

cargo run
